# 03 - Develop Your Intel Feed

We've used ProofPoint's Emerging Threats Rule Summaries as an intel source, we've discussed how THREATfox could be used as an intel source, and we've discussed how posts on X can be used for intel leads. Every time you read a quality post on X, review that person's other posts. Follow the people on X that consistently post quality reporting. Click like on the posts that add value; it will help improve your X suggestions. Mute people that don't add value to your feed, or click the "Not interested in this post" link if it doesn't add value; it will help X improve your suggestions. Over time, your X feed will be focused on CTI posts. 

Identify an AI source that can provide CTI summaries for you. You can prompt Grok things like "Provide me with the latest CTI reporting on SocGholish. Provide reference links that I can verify."
