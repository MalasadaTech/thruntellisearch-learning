# 05 - Master Your Tools

In this collection, I've used free resources that do not require a login. Specifically, we've used urlscan, Virus Total, and Any Run Submissions. I've only discussed simple concepts like checking IP resolutions in VT, searching urlscan based on page titles and resource hashes, and basic Any Run Submissions filters. You will need to take time to understand the capabilities and limitations of each tool.

THERE ARE MANY MORE OUT THERE! As you develop your X suggestions, you will see other thruntellisearch analysts using other tools. As you learn of new tools, you should evaluate their capabilities and limitations.
