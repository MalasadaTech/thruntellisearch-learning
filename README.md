# thruntellisearch-learning
A repo of thruntellisearch stuff for my son.

## Purpose
- To teach my son how to do thruntellisearch. 
- Probably my nephews too if they want to try.
- Because I keep it basic, I think this may work for adults who are wondering if this is something they would be interested in doing.

## Thoughts on this
- I'm writing this in Obsidian.
	- It's free to use.
	- You can download Obsidian, and then download this repo, and view it in Obsidian.
	- Alternatively, you can use whatever markdown reader you like.
		- It also renders quite nicely in VS Code.
	- The markdown files with images (snips) are large because the images are inline Base64 encoded images.
		- This is simpler, so that I don't have to mess around with those MD image links (I don't like that)
- There is a priority to use free tools that can be used without login.
	- Next up on the priority are free tools (with login).
- In the beginning lessons, there isnâ€™t much discussion on what the bad activities are or how they work, it focuses on analyzing infrastructure patterns.
	- Teaching how to analyze code may be out of scope for this (or in-depth code analysis is out of scope).
	- Instead, I will focus on showing examples that can be memorized as something to look for.
		- We are working from the knowledge level of "my son is able to understand basic programming concepts, but isn't able to code on his own".

## 00 - Intro
I discuss the pre-reqs.

## 01 - WebInjects
In this section we discuss web injects TA2726, ZPHP/SmartApeSG, and LandUpdate808. We follow the following pattern:
- Begin with an intel lead
- Use the lead to find compromised sites
- Find the inject pattern
- Use the pattern to find additional compromised sites
- Find an external source to validate our findings

We also discuss the key concept of making the distinction between identifiers for thractors, delivery methods, and malware.
