# thruntellisearch-learning
A repo of thruntellisearch stuff for my son.

## Purpose
- To teach my son how to do thruntellisearch. 
- Probably my nephews too if they want to try.
- There is a priority to use free tools that can be used without login.
	- Next up on the priority are free tools (with login).
- In the beginning lessons, there isnâ€™t much discussion on what the bad activities are or how they work, it focuses on analyzing infrastructure patterns.
	- Teaching how to analyze code may be out of scope for this (or in-depth code analysis is out of scope).
	- Instead, I will focus on showing examples that can be memorized as something to look for.
		- We are working from the knowledge level of "my son is able to understand basic programming concepts, but isn't able to code on his own".

## 00 - Intro
I discuss the pre-reqs.

## 01 - WebInjects
In this section we discuss web injects TA2726, ZPHP/SmartApeSG, and LandUpdate808. We follow the following pattern:
- Begin with an intel lead
- Use the lead to find compromised sites
- Find the inject pattern
- Use the pattern to find additional compromised sites
- Find an external source to validate our findings

We also discuss the key concept of making the distinction between identifiers for thractors, delivery methods, and malware.
