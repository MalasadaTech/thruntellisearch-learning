# 00 - Intro

[TODO: Intro Statement... will go over masquerades, first for Oyster loader from an intel lead on X.]

We've used ProofPoint’s Ruleset Update Summary. That's great because their signatures can generate rules that would fire alerts; those alerts would be analyzed by SOC analysts. This is also great for enthusiasts because they can use it as a lead without needing to validate it via an alert. This allows for hobbyists to practice like the pros. Similarly, we’ve been using the THREATfox IOC submissions for external validations, but we could also use it as an intel lead. A well rounded analyst will use multiple sources as intel leads. In the next topic, we’ll use an X post as an intel lead
