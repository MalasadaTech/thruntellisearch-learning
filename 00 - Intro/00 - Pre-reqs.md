## DRAFT!
These are the concepts that must be known before starting. At some point, I'll find and link some youtube videos that explain these stuffs.

- **Understand DNS**
	- Understand how a domain name needs to be resolved to an IP address
	- Understand that multiple domain names can resolve to the same IP address
- **Understand basic HTML concepts**
	- Understand how the title tag sets the title
- **Understand hashing**
	- Understand how any resource can be ran through a hashing algorithm to generate a unique hash for that resource (most commonly image files and malware files)
- **Understand a defanging**
	- Use a [.] for domains and IPs
	- It can vary with {.} or \.
	- Proofpoint uses a space in their rule titles like example .com
- **Understand domain registration**
- **Understand** that the term “**adversary infrastructure**” is a fancy way to say the domains or IPs that a cyber criminal uses.
