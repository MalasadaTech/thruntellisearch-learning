# 01 - Hypothesis-Driven

We will use the observed technique of masquerading and use that to build a hypothesis - an educated guess. Instead of pretending to be a software site, we could guess that the bad guys could pretend to be an online shopping site - and try to steal your password. Instead of using threat intel as a source, we will use a real website as the source. We’ll find the properties of the site, and we’ll search for any matching patterns for fake sites.
